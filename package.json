  "description": "Handoff is a mobile application that bridges the communication gap between local organizations such as food banks and non-profits, and community members looking to donate. The app allows organizations to post requests about general or specific needs, and then users can browse through this information through either a request feed or a map that displays requests at the location of the organization. A user might want to use it because it can keep them aware of the needs of organizations, and it provides an easy way to find a place where items to donate can be dropped off.",
